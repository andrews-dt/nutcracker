 * Nutcracker essentially multiplexes m client connections over n server
 * connections. Usually m >> n, so that nutcracker can pipeline requests
 * from several clients over a server connection and hence use the connection
 * bandwidth to the server efficiently
 *
 * Client and server connection maintain two fifo queues for requests:
 *
 * 1). in_q (imsg_q):  queue of incoming requests
 * 2). out_q (omsg_q): queue of outstanding (outgoing) requests
 *
 * Request received over the client connection are forwarded to the server by
 * enqueuing the request in the chosen server's in_q. From the client's
 * perspective once the request is forwarded, it is outstanding and is tracked
 * in the client's out_q (unless the request was tagged as noreply). The server
 * in turn picks up requests from its own in_q in fifo order and puts them on
 * the wire. Once the request is outstanding on the wire, and a response is
 * expected for it, the server keeps track of outstanding requests it in its
 * own out_q.
 *
 * The server's out_q enables us to pair a request with a response while the
 * client's out_q enables us to pair request and response in the order in
 * which they are received from the client.
 *
 *
 *      Clients                             Servers
 *                                    .
 *    in_q: <empty>                   .
 *    out_q: req11 -> req12           .   in_q:  req22
 *    (client1)                       .   out_q: req11 -> req21 -> req12
 *                                    .   (server1)
 *    in_q: <empty>                   .
 *    out_q: req21 -> req22 -> req23  .
 *    (client2)                       .
 *                                    .   in_q:  req23
 *                                    .   out_q: <empty>
 *                                    .   (server2)
 *
 * In the above example, client1 has two pipelined requests req11 and req12
 * both of which are outstanding on the server connection server1. On the
 * other hand, client2 has three requests req21, req22 and req23, of which
 * only req21 is outstanding on the server connection while req22 and
 * req23 are still waiting to be put on the wire. The fifo of client's
 * out_q ensures that we always send back the response of request at the head
 * of the queue, before sending out responses of other completed requests in
 * the queue.
